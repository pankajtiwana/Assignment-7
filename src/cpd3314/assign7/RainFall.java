/* Exercise #1 - RainFall Class
 *
 * Write a RainFall class that stores the total rainfall for each of 12 months
 * into an array of doubles. The program should have methods that return the
 * following: 
 * - A setRainfall(int, double) method to set a given month's rainfall. For 
 *     example, setRainfall(0,10) would set January's rainfall to 10.
 * - A getRainfall(int) method to retrieve a given month's rainfall. For 
 *     example, getRainfall(0) would retrieve January's rainfall. 
 * - A getTotal() method to retrieve the total rainfall for the year 
 * - A getAverage() method to retrieve the average monthly rainfall 
 * - A getMax() method to retrieve the month with the most rain as an integer 
 *    (0=Jan, ... 11=Dec)
 * - A getMin() method to retrieve the month with the least rain as an  integer 
 *    (0=Jan, ... 11=Dec)
