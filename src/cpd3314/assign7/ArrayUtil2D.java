/* Exercise #15 - 2D Array Operations
 * 
 * The methods of this class are going to be fed two-dimensional arrays of 
 * doubles. Write methods within this class to perform the following tasks:
 * - getTotal(double[][]) This method should accept a two-dimensional array as 
 *     its argument and return the total of all the values in the array. 
 * - getAverage(double[][]) This method should accept a two-dimensional array as
 *     its argument and return the average of all the values in the array.
 * - getRowTotal(double[][], int) This method should accept a two-dimensional
 *     array as its first argument, and an integer as its second argument. The
 *     second argument should be the subscript of a row in the array. The method
 *     should return the total of the values in the specified row.
 * - gotColumnTotal(double[][], int) This method should accept a two-dimensional
 *     array as its first argument, and an integer as its second argument. The
 *     second argument should be the subscript of a column in the array. The 
 *     method should return the total of the values in the specified column.
 * - getHighestInRow(double[][], int) This method should accept a two-dimensional
 *     array as its first argument, and an integer as its second argument. The
 *     second argument should be the subscript of a row in the array. The method
 *     should return the highest value in the specified row of the array.
 * - getLowestInRow(double[][], int) This method should accept a two-dimensional
 *     array as its first argument, and an integer as its second argument. The
 *     second argument should be the subscript of a row in the array. The method
 *     should return the lowest value in the specified row of the array.
